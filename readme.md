## Reflection
a. During the planning stage, there were no significant issues, and I was on track to complete the assignment within the given class period. However, I found the process unenjoyable and decided to pivot to something more engaging. Through this pivot, I learned that shifting focus inherently creates time constraints. As a result, I chose to concentrate the majority of my effort on one key element—the landing page—to ensure it was something I could be confident in. This approach let me focus on perfecting the landing page first, then allocate thoughtful effort to lower-priority pages while still meeting my minimum viable product goals. In hindsight, I could have planned for potential pivots by building in more flexibility to accommodate changes without compromising time or quality

b. Aside from the pivot, there were no major issues in completing this assignment.

c. Given I had the urge to change in the middle of the project, I'm content with the current layout of my webpage. However I will add the remaining pages for the rest of the cast and implement more working links.

d. Make a wireframe that complies with the requirements of the assignment, and create another wireframe that does the same but with a bit more creativity.
